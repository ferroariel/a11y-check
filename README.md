## About the Project

This project is part of a series of four episodes from the podcast [**Web Accessibility For All**](https://open.spotify.com/show/1CMZvVF4hMBc5rxGYtwfPy). The podcast is dedicated to discussing and promoting web accessibility practices. You can listen to the episodes on Spotify. In these episodes, we cover various aspects of accessibility testing, from unit tests to end-to-end tests, using this app as an example.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into several branches, each focusing on a specific type of accessibility testing:

- **main**: Contains the core React components of the app.
- **unit**: Contains unit testing samples using Jest and @testing-library/react along with axe-core.
- **integration**: Contains integration testing samples.
- **e2e**: Contains end-to-end testing samples.

Explore the different branches to see how accessibility testing is implemented across various levels of the app's functionality.
